"""
This script generates a submission based on a cross-validaiton approach.

Inspiration from here (http://webmining.olariu.org/kaggle-driver-telematics/):

    For each driver, take 180 trips and label them as 1s. Take 180 trips from other drivers and label them as 0s. Train and test on the remaining 20 trips from this driver and on another 20 trips from other drivers. That’s it.

    Can we improve on this? Yes. Take more than just 180 trips from other drivers. Best results I’ve got were with values between 4×180 and 10×180. In order to avoid an unbalanced training set, I also duplicated the data from the current driver.
