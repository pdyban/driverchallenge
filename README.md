# Driver Telematics Analysis
Driver Telematics Analysis is a Kaggle challenge. For more details, see the [challenge page](http://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis/data). Besides solving a machine learning problem, we want to learn how to use git and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Submissions can be generated by running scripts from ``scripts`` directory, using root as working directory. Features implement a common interface and are stored inside ``features`` package. Utilities like plotting, i/o are part of ``utils`` package. Working notes are stored as [IPython notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org) in ``notebooks`` directory.

# Todo:
- replace power computation in the distance function with numpy's squared distance (should be more efifcient)
- plot angle feature in color over trip track
- plot angle feature histograms, before and after RDP
- run RDP, recompute angle feature submissions
- analyze [article by Olariu](http://webmining.olariu.org/kaggle-driver-telematics/)
