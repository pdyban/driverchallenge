# Driver Telematics Analysis
Driver Telematics Analysis is a Kaggle challenge. For more details, see the [challenge page](http://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis/data). Besides solving a machine learning problem, we want to learn how to use git and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Submissions can be generated by running scripts from ``scripts`` directory, using root as working directory. Features implement a common interface and are stored inside ``features`` package. Utilities like plotting, i/o are part of ``utils`` package. Working notes are stored as [IPython notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org) in ``notebooks`` directory.

# Todo:
- compute best RDP epsilon value -> check xx work
- create script that reduces trips using RDP and stores them as *.npy
- analyze [article by Olariu](http://webmining.olariu.org/kaggle-driver-telematics/)
- use sklearn's cross-correlation
- understand how to measure score offline (maybe use cross-correlation's built-in score)
- compute more features:
  * more percentiles
  * angle features
  * use speed w/o interpolation
